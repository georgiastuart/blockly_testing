<h2 id="get-8-12-cs-certified-by-fall-2017">Get 8-12 CS Certified by Fall 2017!</h2>

<p>With the addition of the <a href="endorsement.pdf">Computer Science track in the STEM Endorsement</a> and the requirement that districts offer Computer Science and make it available to all students, computer science certified teachers are in high demand. This <strong>free</strong> course series from <a href="utdallas.edu/scimathed">UT Dallas Science and Mathematics Education Department</a> is intended to prepare certified Texas teachers to successfully complete the <a href="http://cms.texes-ets.org/files/9014/6486/8792/computer_science_8_12_241_TAAG.pdf">8-12 Computer Science Test (241)</a> and teach computer science!</p>



<h2 id="who-is-eligible">Who is eligible?</h2>

<p>To enroll, you must be a teacher certified in math or science. </p>



<h2 id="is-prior-programming-experience-required">Is prior programming experience required?</h2>

<p>No! We will start with the basics. </p>



<h2 id="whats-covered">What’s covered?</h2>

<p>The two courses will cover everything outlined in the TEXES Computer Science 241 standards for Domain II - Program Design and Development and Domain III - Programming Language Topics. In addition, we’ll cover as much as possible of Domain IV - Special Topics. </p>

<p>We also focus on the TEKS for Computer Science I and II and the standards for AP Computer Science Principles. This course will <strong>not</strong> be effective preparation for AP Computer Science A. </p>



<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>Computer Science for Texas Teachers is a sixteen week, six hour course split into two eight week sessions. Each course will be taught with a blended model–there will be <strong>significant online instruction and interaction</strong>.  In addition, attendance at one of the two in-person sessions per week is required (though you are welcome to attend both to receive more in-person assistance!). The in-person sessions will be held on the UT Dallas campus in Richardson, TX.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://coursebook.utdallas.edu/search/searchresults/sci5v06.091.17s">Session I</a></strong> runs <strong>March 6, 2017 through May 8, 2017</strong>. The in-class meetings will be held on two days: <strong>Monday or Thursday from 5:30 pm to 8:15 pm</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Session II</strong> runs <strong>June 12, 2017 through August 8, 2017</strong>. In class meetings TBD. </p>



<h2 id="eligibility-for-graduate-credit">Eligibility for graduate credit</h2>

<p>Both courses will be eligible for graduate credit towards the Masters of Arts in Teaching for either Science Education or Math Education. Some scholarships are available for those who wish to enroll for graduate credit, but it is <strong>not</strong> required to participate in the program.</p>



<h2 id="grant-funding-and-goodies">Grant funding and goodies!</h2>

<p>Thanks to the <strong>TI Foundation</strong>, we are able to supply all participants with TI-Nspires, Innovator Hubs, and accessories. </p>

<p>We are currently submitting a proposal to the Texas Regional Collaborative’s new WeTeach_CS program, which will provide additional scholarship funding, technology benefits, test preparation and registration assistance, and more!</p>
